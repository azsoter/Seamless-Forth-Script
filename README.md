# Seamless-Forth-Script
 A Forth based scripting language that integrates seamlessly with C.

You can check out my other forth project at https://github.com/azsoter/forth-devel
which is a pleasing to a Forth programmer's eyes, but as it turns out it is somewhat clumsy
to integrate with C code where lots of functions need to be called from Forth.
This version is perhaps less elegant as a Forth system, but should integrate more seamlessly
with C code.

The idea here is to add live scripting to embedded programs written in C, not to implement
entire systems in Forth.
